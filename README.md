# File Security using ECC
A simple python program to implement file security using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Algorithm.

It is a simple python program to implement file security using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Algorithm. It is a hybrid cryptography algorithm that uses both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to encrypt and decrypt files. It uses AES-256 algorithm for symmetric cryptography and ECC algorithm for asymmetric cryptography.
